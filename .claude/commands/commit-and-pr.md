Check the git diff to review the changes and then commit and push. Then check the diff for all commits on this branch and use `gh` (the Github CLI) to create a pull request for this branch into main. Assign the PR to me using the @me. Ensure you are writing the PR description and title with relevance to what was changed for the whole branch not just the most recent commits. Ignore commits that were pulled into this branch from somewhere else.
